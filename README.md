# ICU Real-time Monitoring Software
Our software application provides a plethora of features for viewing and analyzing biomedical signals, comprising 2 display graphs each able to carry multiple signals for display and anaysis.

## Available Features

#### Multi-port display: 
The main interface contains 2 graphs, each able to carry multiple signals.

#### Multi-channel: 
Allows you to view different channels in the same graph simultaneously.

#### Browse for files:
Allows you to browse your computer for signal files to load into the application.
 
### Panning and Zooming
Effortlessly pan and zoom within the signal plots to focus on specific time intervals or details of interest.

### Speed Control
Adjust the speed of signal display to suit your monitoring needs, allowing for real-time adjustments based on the situation.

### Scrolling Plots
Scroll through the signal plots to review past data while continuing to monitor real-time updates.

### Shortcuts
Utilize keyboard shortcuts for quick access to common functionalities, enhancing user experience and efficiency.

### Play, Pause, Rewind, Replay
Control signal playback with options to play, pause, rewind, and replay segments of interest, facilitating dynamic analysis.

### Signal Management
Delete signals or move them between graphs as needed to organize and focus on relevant data.

#### Link Graphs function:
Allows you to link two graphs together. When two graphs are linked, the controls for one graph will control both graphs, very helpful in comparing multiple signals.

#### Data statistics: 
The application can calculate a variety of data statistics for each signal, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum value, and maximum value.

### PDF Report Generation
Produce detailed PDF reports containing screenshots and statistics of the displayed signals, providing comprehensive documentation and analysis.

## How to Use the Application

You can then use our inituitive user-friendly graph controls to view and analyze the signals in different ways!

1. **Add Signals**: Add signals to the graphs for monitoring by selecting them from the available options.
2. **Graph Controls**: Utilize the various graph controls such as panning, zooming, speed control, and scrolling to analyze the signals in real-time.
3. **Customization**: Customize signal appearance and legends for clarity and ease of interpretation.
4. **Interactivity**: Use shortcuts and playback controls for dynamic signal analysis and monitoring.
5. **Generate Reports**: Create PDF reports containing screenshots and statistics for documentation and analysis purposes.
6. **Signal Management**: Manage signals by deleting or moving them between graphs to focus on relevant data.


### Libraries : 
PyQt6, numpy, pandas, pyqtgraph, functools, fpdf
